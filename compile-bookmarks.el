;;; Commentary:
;;
;; compile-bookmarks.el allows you to bookmark your compile commands and retain
;; them across sessions.
;;
;; When you enable the global `compile-bookmarks-mode', your bookmarks will be
;; loaded from `compile-bm-save-file'.  If you quit emacs with the mode enabled,
;; the bookmarks will be stored automatically.
;;
;; You can manage your bookmarks with `compile-bm-add', `compile-bm-remove' and
;; `compile-bm-recompile', or use the "Compile" menu.
;;
;;; Change Log:
;;
;;    Fixed force argument in `compile-bm-load-list'.
;;    Added Storing and recovering of last active compile command.
;;
;; 2008-06-09 (0.1)
;;    Initial release.
